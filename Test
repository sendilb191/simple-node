Got it 👍 Since both projects were in the same company, you should list the company once and then break it down into Project 1 and Project 2 under the same role. That way, it shows continuity while also highlighting your contributions across multiple projects.

Here’s how you can structure it:


---

📌 Resume Example (Same Company, 2 Projects)

Company Name – Frontend Developer

MM/YYYY – Present

Project 1: React Application Development

Developed and integrated new application routes using React Router to enhance navigation and improve user experience.

Implemented a dynamic React Grid layout to display content in a responsive, user-friendly manner.

Collaborated with the team to ensure scalable, maintainable code aligned with project architecture.


Project 2: Migration from CWA to Micro-Frontend

Migrated a Single Page CWA application into a scalable Micro-Frontend architecture, enabling independent deployment of features.

Designed and implemented Webpack Module Federation and routing strategies for smooth integration with host applications.

Developed shared reusable components to ensure consistency across multiple MFEs.

Authored unit and integration test cases (Jest/React Testing Library) to ensure reliability, increasing test coverage and reducing defects.

Partnered with cross-functional teams to execute migration with minimal downtime.


Tech Stack: React, Redux, TypeScript, Webpack 5 Module Federation, Jest, React Testing Library

✅ This format shows you worked on different projects within the same company but keeps it clean for ATS scanning.

👉 Do you want me to also make a one-line summary for each project (short version) in case you want to keep your resume more concise?



Nice 👌 You should definitely showcase this in your resume — but the trick is to write it in a professional, impact-driven way instead of just describing what you did. Recruiters and interviewers want to see what skills you applied and what value you added.

Here’s how you can frame your current work in your resume:

📌 Example Resume Points for Your Current React Project

Developed and integrated new application routes using React Router to improve navigation and user experience.

Implemented a dynamic React Grid layout to organize and display content effectively, enhancing usability and responsiveness.

🔑 Tips:

1. Use action verbs → Developed, Implemented, Built, Integrated, Optimized.


2. Highlight technologies → React, React Router, Redux (if used), CSS/LESS, TypeScript, etc.


3. Show impact → For example, “improved navigation by X%,” “reduced code duplication,” “enhanced user experience.”


4. Tailor for your role → If you’re aiming for frontend roles, emphasize UI/UX and component design. If full stack, mention backend integration too.

👉 Do you want me to create a ready-to-add bullet point section for your resume based on your React project (with ATS-friendly wording), or would you prefer a more story-style project description (for portfolio/GitHub)?
