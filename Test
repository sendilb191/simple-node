📌 Example Resume Points for Your Current React Project

🔑 Tips:

1. Use action verbs → Developed, Implemented, Built, Integrated, Optimized.


2. Highlight technologies → React, React Router, Redux (if used), CSS/LESS, TypeScript, etc.


3. Show impact → For example, “improved navigation by X%,” “reduced code duplication,” “enhanced user experience.”


4. Tailor for your role → If you’re aiming for frontend roles, emphasize UI/UX and component design. If full stack, mention backend integration too.

👉 Do you want me to create a ready-to-add bullet point section for your resume based on your React project (with ATS-friendly wording), or would you prefer a more story-style project description (for portfolio/GitHub)?
